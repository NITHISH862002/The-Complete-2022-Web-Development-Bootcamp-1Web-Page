  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    A very plesant morning to one and all here i am going to share information on decentralisation
    So let us see what is decentralisation and applications of decentralisation
    Decentralisation is just opposite to centeralization.Consider an example <a href="#">RBI</a> Indian Currency are controled by
    RBI this is an example of centeralization. Example for decentralisationis Bitcoin which is a type of cryptocurrencies is not controlled by any goverment authorities
    <br>Let us see what are the application of decentralisation.
    One of the major application of decentralisation is Block-Chain Technology. Let me explain how block chain works block chain is similar to singly linked list in singly linked list we will be storing data and address of the next node
    same as in block chain we will be storing data which is <strong>>=1MB</strong> and hashvalue which is 16-bit length of hexa-decimal type. Block-Chain follws <strong>DLT</strong>
    technology.Each and every technology have advantages and disadvantages one of the major disadvantage is that in block chain we only store data upto 1MB and back tracking is not possible .Inorder to over come this there is a similar kind of
    technology called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangle-cryptocurrency.asp"> IotaTangle</a> IotaTangle uses DAG algorithma and DLT technology
    There are no restrictions like Block chain technology. <br> Let us see where are block chain are being used
